/**
 * Wallet Controller — Barrel re-export
 *
 * Split into focused sub-controllers for maintainability:
 *   - walletBalanceController:     balance, settings, sync, expiring coins, coin rules, scheduled drops, recharge preview
 *   - walletTransactionController: transaction history, details, summary, counts, categories breakdown
 *   - walletPaymentController:     topup, withdraw, payment processing, gateway integration, refunds, dev topup, webhooks
 *
 * All exports are re-exported here for backward compatibility — existing
 * route files continue to import from 'walletController' without changes.
