### Part 2: Order Status SMS Notifications ✅
**File:** `src/merchantroutes/orders.ts`

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Added imports for SMSService and Merchant model
2. ✅ Integrated SMS notification in `PUT /:id/status` route

4. ✅ Fetches merchant business name for personalized messages
5. ✅ Respects `notifyCustomer` flag from request
6. ✅ Graceful error handling - doesn't fail request if SMS fails

**Integration Point:**
```typescript
// After order status is successfully updated
if (notifyCustomer && updatedOrder.customer?.phone) {
  try {
    const merchant = await Merchant.findById(merchantId);
    const storeName = merchant?.businessName || 'Store';
    const formattedPhone = SMSService.formatPhoneNumber(updatedOrder.customer.phone);

    await SMSService.sendOrderStatusUpdate(
      formattedPhone,
      updatedOrder.orderNumber,
      status,
      storeName
    );
  } catch (smsError) {
    console.warn('Failed to send SMS notification:', smsError);
  }
}
```

**SMS Messages by Status:**
- `preparing` → "Your order #XXX from [Store] is being prepared. We'll update you soon!"
- `ready` → "Good news! Your order #XXX from [Store] is ready for pickup/delivery!"
- `out_for_delivery` → "Your order #XXX from [Store] is out for delivery. It will arrive soon!"
- `delivered` → "Your order #XXX from [Store] has been delivered. Thank you for your order!"
- `cancelled` → "Your order #XXX from [Store] has been cancelled. Please contact support if you have questions."

3. ✅ Sends SMS to merchant when stock falls to/below low stock threshold
4. ✅ Fetches merchant phone number from database
5. ✅ Graceful error handling - doesn't fail request if SMS fails

**Integration Point:**
```typescript
// After product is successfully updated
if (product.inventory && product.inventory.stock <= product.inventory.lowStockThreshold) {
  try {
    const merchant = await Merchant.findById(req.merchantId);
    if (merchant && merchant.phone) {
      const formattedPhone = SMSService.formatPhoneNumber(merchant.phone);
      await SMSService.sendLowStockAlert(
        formattedPhone,
        product.name,
        product.inventory.stock
      );
    }
  } catch (smsError) {
    console.warn('Failed to send low stock SMS:', smsError);

PUT /api/merchant/orders/:orderId/status
{
  "status": "preparing",
  "notifyCustomer": true
}
```

### 3. Test Low Stock Alert
Update product inventory to trigger alert:
```bash
PUT /api/merchant/products/:productId
{
  "inventory": {
    "stock": 3,           # Below threshold
    "lowStockThreshold": 5
  }
}
```

### 4. Send Custom SMS
Use SMSService directly in your code:
```typescript
import SMSService from './services/SMSService';

// Send custom SMS
await SMSService.send({
  to: '+919876543210',
  message: 'Your custom message here'
});

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### SMS Not Sending?
1. Check Twilio credentials in .env
2. Verify Twilio account has funds
3. Check phone number format (should include country code)
4. Review server logs for error messages
5. Verify Twilio phone number is verified

### Console Logging Instead of SMS?
- This is expected if Twilio credentials are not configured
- Check `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, and `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` in .env

### SMS Sent but Customer Didn't Receive?
1. Verify customer phone number is correct in database
2. Check Twilio logs for delivery status
3. Verify phone number is in E.164 format
4. Check if number is on DND/blocked list
