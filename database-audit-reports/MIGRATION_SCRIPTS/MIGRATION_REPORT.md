# Database Cleanup Migration Report

**Date:** November 15, 2025
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY
**Database:** MongoDB (test)

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully executed two critical database cleanup migrations to fix data inconsistencies identified in the database audit. All migrations completed without data loss, and all verifications passed.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Standardized 31 FAQs by removing duplicate ID fields
- ✅ Fixed 7 products with broken category references
- ✅ Maintained data integrity (no records lost)
- ✅ Dropped 1 problematic index on FAQs collection
- ✅ Created "Uncategorized" category for orphaned products

---

## Migration 1: FAQs ID Standardization

### Objective
Remove duplicate `id` and `uniqueId` fields from the FAQs collection, keeping only MongoDB's native `_id` field.

### Problem Statement
- 32 FAQs contained redundant `id` field (e.g., "faq-general-2")
- Some FAQs potentially had `uniqueId` field
- Unique index on `id` field was causing conflicts
- This created unnecessary complexity and potential data inconsistencies

### Solution Implemented
1. **Index Management**
   - Dropped `id_1` unique index on FAQs collection
   - Attempted to drop `uniqueId_1` index (did not exist)
   - Retained essential indexes (category, order, isActive, text search)

2. **Data Cleanup**
   - Removed `id` field from 31 FAQs
   - Removed `uniqueId` field where present
   - Kept only MongoDB's `_id` field for unique identification

### Results
```
Total FAQs: 32 (unchanged)
FAQs Modified: 31
Indexes Dropped: 1 (id_1)
Duplicate ID Fields Remaining: 0
Status: ✅ SUCCESS
```

### Before/After Comparison

**Before:**
```json
{
  "_id": "690226e2a433c0e05b8cd713",
  "id": "faq-general-3",
  "question": "Can I share my partner benefits...",
  "answer": "Partner benefits are tied...",
  "category": "general",
  "order": 3,
  "isActive": true
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "_id": "690226e2a433c0e05b8cd713",
  "question": "Can I share my partner benefits...",
  "answer": "Partner benefits are tied...",
  "category": "general",
  "order": 3,
  "isActive": true
}
```

### Indexes After Migration
- `_id_`: Primary index
- `category_1`: Category lookup
- `order_1`: Ordering
- `isActive_1`: Active status filter
- `category_1_isActive_1_order_1`: Compound index for efficient queries
- `subcategory_1`: Subcategory lookup
- `question_text`: Full-text search on questions
- `tags_1`: Tag-based filtering
- `isActive_1_viewCount_-1`: Popular FAQs by view count
- `tags_1_isActive_1`: Tag filtering with active status

---

## Migration 2: Fix Broken Category References

### Objective
Fix products that reference non-existent categories by linking them to an "Uncategorized" category.

### Problem Statement
- 7 products referenced category IDs that don't exist in the categories collection
- Categories deleted: `68ee29d08c4fa11015d70340`, `68ee29d08c4fa11015d70342`, `68ee29d08c4fa11015d70343`, `68ee29d08c4fa11015d70344`
- This broke referential integrity and could cause API errors

### Solution Implemented
1. **Category Creation**
   - Created new "Uncategorized" category
   - Category ID: `69183acfd9142810ef5ff00a`
   - Added to the 24 existing categories (now 25 total)

2. **Product Updates**
   - Updated 7 products with invalid category references
   - Set their category to "Uncategorized"

### Products Fixed

### Results
```
Total Products: 389 (unchanged)
Products Modified: 7
Categories Created: 1 (Uncategorized)
Total Categories: 25 (was 24)
Invalid References Remaining: 0
Status: ✅ SUCCESS
